       ffeeaattsseell  receives  a  set  SS of objects, values associated with each of
       them, a cost function cc with subsets of S as domain and real numbers as
       image,  and searches for a subset X in S such as c(X) is minimum (i.e.,
       there are no Y in S, such as c(Y) < c(X)).  The  minima  subsets  found
       are  printed  into the standard output.  The featsel program may use as
       search algorithm an implementation of the U-Curve-Search (UCS), and  as
       the cost function the hamming distance and the absolute sum.

       -a algorithm-name
              Selects  the _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m_-_n_a_m_e as the algorithm used in the search.
              The default value is _u_c_s (U-Curve Search); other valid names are
              _u_b_b  (U-Curve Branch and Bound), _p_f_s (Poset Forest Search), _s_f_f_s
              (Sequential Forward Floating Selection), _s_f_s (Sequential Forward
              Selection), and _e_s (Exhaustive Search).

       -c cost-function-name
              Selects  the  _c_o_s_t_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e  as  the  cost  function of the
              search. The default value is _a_b_s___s_u_m_; other valid names are _h_a_m_-
              _m_i_n_g___d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_,  _m_c_e  (Mean  Conditional  Entropy  for W-operator
              design), _e_x_p_l_i_c_i_t (cost function values explicitly defined  from
              file), _m_e_a_n___a_b_s___s_u_m_.

       -f input-file-name
              Uses  as  instance  either  a XML or a DAT file _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e_,
              containing the elements of the set, their names and values.

       -h     Displays this help screen.

       -m number-of-minima
              The number of minima to be showed in  the  standard  output.  It
              should be and integer grater than zero, and the default value is
              1.

       -n number-of-elements
              If the option -f is not used, creates a random set with  _n_u_m_b_e_r_-
              _o_f_-_e_l_e_m_e_n_t_s  elements with a single value. It should be an inte-
              ger greater than zero. The default value is 3.

       -r range
              If the option -f is not used, creates the elements of the random
              set with a single value greater or equal than zero and less than
              _r_a_n_g_e_.  The default value is 1000.

       -s     Stores all the visited subsets into the file called _v_i_s_i_t_e_d_._l_o_g

       -t1 threshold
              Set a _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d value that ends the execution if a value less or
              equal  to it is computed by the cost function. Used in the first
              step (pre-processing) of a heuristic procedure.

       -t2 max-number-of-calls-of-cost-function
              Set a _m_a_x_-_n_u_m_b_e_r_-_o_f_-_c_a_l_l_s_-_o_f_-_c_o_s_t_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n value that  ends  the
              execution if the cost function is computed that number of times.
              It is used in the second step of a heuristic procedure.

       _e_t_c_/_f_e_a_t_s_e_l_._c_o_n_f
              The program configuration file (not implemented yet).
       _e_t_c_/_c_o_s_t_f_u_n_c_._c_o_n_f

              (not implemented yet).

       PATH   May  be  useful  to add the full pathname of the directory where
              the featsel binary is located. The configuration files  must  be
              at the same directory of the binary.

       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:
       Bad magic number.
              The input file does not look like a XML file.
       Bad cost.
